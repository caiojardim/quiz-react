<h1>Quiz</h1>

<p>This project had the idea of recreating creating a quiz game with react</p>

<h4>Demo: https://cj-quiz-react.netlify.app</h4>

<h2> What I learned with this project: </h2>
<ul>
    <li>Use the hook useParams</li>
    <li>Validate answers and show the result</li>
</ul>

<h2> What I need to improve on this project: </h2>
<ul>
    <li>Create a backend to validade the answers and store the quizes</li>
    <li>Create a page to let the users create their own quizes</li>
</ul>
